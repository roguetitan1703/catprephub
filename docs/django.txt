Core Functionalities:

User Accounts: Django's built-in user authentication system allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles. You can customize the user model using Django's built-in functionalities or third-party libraries to include additional user information (e.g., username, email, preferred study areas).

Mock Tests:

Models: Create TestSection, Question, and TestResult models as described previously.
Views: Develop views for displaying available test sections, serving questions based on user selection, handling user input during tests, calculating scores, and storing results in the TestResult model. Django's form handling capabilities will be helpful in managing user input during tests.
Time Limits: Utilize Python's built-in timer functions or libraries like datetime to manage time limits for each section.
Performance Analysis:

Models: Utilize the TestResult model to store user scores for different sections.
Views: Create a view for the "My Progress" section that retrieves user test results from the database and prepares data for visualization.
Data Visualization: Integrate Chart.js or a similar library within your templates to generate charts representing user performance across sections and over time based on TestResult data.
Reward System (Optional):

Models: Consider creating a Reward model if you want to offer a variety of rewards, and a UserReward model to track user claims.
Views: Implement views for displaying available rewards and handling user requests for redemption. This might involve integrating with a payment gateway or partnering with coaching institutes (requires additional development).
Additional features:

1. Views:

Develop views for handling user interaction with the mock test:
Displaying Available Sections: Create a view to fetch all TestSection objects and display them to the user.
Serving Questions: Implement a view that takes the chosen TestSection ID as input and retrieves a set of questions belonging to that section. You can use random selection or a specific order to present questions.
Handling User Input: Create a view to handle user selections (answers) for each question. This view might receive user input (e.g., selected option ID or answer text) and the current question ID.
Calculating Scores: Develop a view or logic to calculate the score based on correct answers after the user completes a section.
Storing Results: Implement a view or logic to store the user's test results (attempted questions, correct answers, score) in the TestResult model.
2. Forms:

Consider using Django forms to create user-friendly interfaces for selecting options in the test:
Design a form with radio buttons or a dropdown menu corresponding to the question options.
Associate the form with the view handling user input.
3. Time Limits:

Utilize Python's time module or libraries like datetime to manage time limits for each section.
Track the start time when the user begins a section.
Display a countdown timer or disable question submission after the time limit expires.
4. Template Integration:

Create Django templates to display the user interface for the mock test:
List available sections on a page.
Render the questions with appropriate answer selection options (forms).
Display feedback or scores after completing a section.
5. User Authentication (Optional):

Implement user authentication if you want to track individual user results:
Integrate Django's authentication system or a third-party solution.
Associate test results with logged-in users.
Additional Considerations:

Implement error handling and validation for user input and form submissions.
Consider storing user responses alongside the results for review purposes.
Use Django's session framework to maintain user state during the test.
Designate a "Submit Test" functionality to trigger score calculation and result storage.

These features require additional planning and development effort. Here's a high-level overview:

Community Engagement:

Models: You might need models for Community, UserCommunity, and potentially Post or Chat depending on the specific functionalities.
Views: Develop views for displaying communities, joining/leaving communities, creating/posting content, and potentially chat functionality. Consider using libraries like Django Channels for real-time chat features.
Ranker Board: Implement a mechanism to calculate and display top performers based on user results (stored in TestResult).
Learning Resources:

Views: Create views for displaying a curated list of learning resources categorized by type (e.g., Youtube videos, PDFs). You can store resource links and descriptions in a model like LearningResource.
Informational Pages:

Views: Develop simple views for static content like "About Us," "Contact Us," and "Feedback." You can create templates for these pages with relevant information.
Overall Development Process:

Project Setup: Start by creating a new Django project and setting up your development environment.
Models: Define your data models for users, tests, results, rewards (optional), communities (optional), and learning resources (optional).
Views: Develop views for each functionality as described above. Utilize Django's form handling, template rendering, and database interaction capabilities.
Templates: Create Django templates for user interfaces like test sections, performance analysis, user profile, community features (optional), and informational pages.
JavaScript: Implement basic JavaScript functionalities within templates for client-side validation, user interactions, and potentially integrating with Chart.js for visualizations.
Authentication: Implement Django's user authentication system or a third-party library for secure login, registration, and user management.
